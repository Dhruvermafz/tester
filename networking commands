What Are Networking Commands?
Every system is connected to numerous different networks and systems through internal or external network channels. These network settings often run into issues and affect the system’s working. Such network problems can be resolved using ‘networking commands.’ 

These commands are specifically designed to troubleshoot network problems with minimum complexity using the windows command prompt tool.
This include everything from the IP address of the system to the IP address of the server in which a website or URL is hosted. The operating system acts as an intermediate platform between the user and the underlying network infrastructure. To use the below commands in Windows operating system, one needs to click on ''Start,'' go to ''Run,'' and type ''cmd.'' This will open the command prompt. In Mac OS, you can use the terminal application.

Next, let’s take a look at the networking commands,

Networking Commands
The below mentioned commands are some of the most useful commands required to troubleshoot network problems and configure network settings.

1. IPCONFIG
<image ipconfig>

The IPCONFIG network command provides a comprehensive view of information regarding the IP address configuration of the device we are currently working on.

The IPConfig command also provides us with some variation in the primary command that targets specific system settings or data, which are:

IPConfig/all - Provides primary output with additional information about network adapters.
IPConfig/renew - Used to renew the system’s IP address.
IPConfig/release - Removes the system’s current IP address.
Command to enter in Prompt - ipconfig

IpConfig Release and Renew
Have you ever noticed your network is slow, or you have the dreaded 'Connected No Internet' message? This may be happening because the IP address has been renewed by the internet service provider or some other source. One thing you should try before calling the service line is typing the following in order. Ipconfig /release will clear all that information and reset your connection. Ipconfig /renew will do a sort of 'reboot' on that and grab a new IP.

ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew

2. NSLOOKUP
<image nslookup>
The NSLOOKUP command is used to troubleshoot network connectivity issues in the system. Using the nslookup command, we can access the information related to our system’s DNS server, i.e., domain name and IP address.

Command to enter in Prompt - nslookup

3. HOSTNAME
<image hostname>

The HOSTNAME command displays the hostname of the system. The hostname command is much easier to use than going into the system settings to search for it.

Command to enter in Prompt - hostname

4. PING
<image ping>

The Ping command is one of the most widely used commands in the prompt tool, as it allows the user to check the connectivity of our system to another host.

This command sends four experimental packets to the destination host to check whether it receives them successfully, if so, then, we can communicate with the destination host. But in case the packets have not been received, that means, no communication can be established with the destination host.

Command to enter in Prompt - ping www.destination_host_name.com

5. TRACERT
<image tracert>
The TRACERT command is used to trace the route during the transmission of the data packet over to the destination host and also provides us with the “hop” count during transmission.

Using the number of hops and the hop IP address, we can troubleshoot network issues and identify the point of the problem during the transmission of the data packet.

Command to enter in Prompt- tracert IP-address OR tracert www.destination_host_name.com


6. NETSTAT
<image netstat>

The Netstat command as the name suggests displays an overview of all the network connections in the device. The table shows detail about the connection protocol, address, and the current state of the network.

Command to enter in Prompt - netstat

7. ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)
<image arp>

The ARP command is used to access the mapping structure of IP addresses to the MAC address. This provides us with a better understanding of the transmission of packets in the network channel.

Command to enter in Prompt - arp

8. SYSTEMINFO
<image systemuinfo>

Using the SYSTEMINFO command, we can access the system’s hardware and software details, such as processor data, booting data, Windows version, etc.

Command to enter in Prompt - systeminfo

9. Route
<image route>
In IP networks, routing tables are used to direct packets from one subnet to another. The Route command provides the device’s routing tables. To get this result, just type route print. The Route command returns the routing table, and the user can make changes by Commands such as Route Add, Route Delete, and Route Change, which allows modifying the routing table as a requirement.

10. Path Ping
We discussed the Ping command and the Tracert command. There are similarities between these commands. The pathping command which provides a combination of the best aspects of Tracert and Ping.

This command takes 300 seconds to gather statistics and then returns reports on latency and packet loss statistics at intermediate hops between the source and the target in more detail than those reports provided by Ping or Tracert commands.

The syntax for path ping is as follows:

path ping [-n] [-h] [-g <Hostlist>] [-p <Period>] [-q <NumQueries> [-w <timeout>] [-i <IPaddress>] [-4 <IPv4>] [-6 <IPv6>][<TargetName>]

N: Prevents path ping functioning from attempting to resolve routers’ IP addresses to their names.
-h MaxHops: This tracert option specifies the maximum number of hops in the search for the target. If the MaxHops option is not specified the target has not been found by 30 hops then the tracert command will stop looking.
-w timeout: A timeout value must be specified while executing this ping command. It adjusts the amount of time in milliseconds.
-ip <IPaddress>: Indicates the source address.
target: This is the destination IP address or a hostname user want to ping.
